The first one is an overview of responsive design and introduces the way you\u2019ll need to shift your thinking as you go from desktop first design, to responsive design.  Lessons 2, 3, 4 and 5 will cover the important theoretical concepts of responsive design, and include plenty of hands-on exercises implementing what you\u2019ve learned.  \n\n### Lesson 1 - Why Responsive?\nWhat is responsive web design and why is it important? What kinds of devices should we be targeting with our design? How can we best leverage the different capabilities of each device to provide great experiences to users? You\u2019ll also make sure that your development environment is ready to go. \n\n<strong>Topics covered:</strong>\n\n* What is responsive design?\n* Why does responsive design work for any device?\n* Remote debugging and emulation in the browser\n\n### Lesson 2 - Starting Small\nThe best way to get started is to start small and build up. In this lesson, we\u2019ll cover the key components that make a site great on a small screen, including setting the viewport, adding content and sizing the content to the viewport.  You\u2019ll start the home town site project, by making sure that it looks good on a small screen.  \n\n<strong>Topics covered:</strong>\n\n* Why start small and build up?\n* What is the viewport?\n* Sizing content the content to the viewport\n  * avoiding static sized items\n* Touch targets, and why they should be large\n\n### Lesson 3 - Building Up\nOnce you\u2019ve got a page optimized for small screens, it\u2019s time to start thinking about how they\u2019ll look on larger screens.  Learn how to use CSS media queries to add breakpoints that change the layout depending on the screen size or other device characteristics.\n\n<strong>Topics covered:</strong>\n\n* CSS media queries\n* What is a breakpoint, and how to choose one\n* Using the CSS flexbox to modify layout\n\n### Lesson 4 - Common Responsive Patterns\nNow that you\u2019ve got the basics of responsive design down, you\u2019ll learn about and practice some of the common layout design patterns used across sites. You'll also iterate on the home town site project, creating breakpoints for tablet and desktop layouts using the patterns from this lesson.\n\n<strong>Topics covered:</strong>\n\n* Mostly fluid pattern\n* Column drop pattern\n* Layout shifter pattern\n* Off canvas pattern\n\n### Lesson 5 - Optimizations\nLearn strategies for minor breakpoints used to adjust the margins or padding on an element, or increase the font size to make it feel more natural in the layout. You\u2019ll also learn about strategies for dealing with tables and optimal text readability. At the end of the lesson, you'll iterate for the last time on the home town site, adding minor breakpoints to really make the experience stand out.\n\n<strong>Topics covered:</strong>\n\n* Minor break points\n* Optimizing text layout\n  * font size\n  * optimal line length\n* Responsive tables, and strategies for dealing with them", "assistants": [], "new_release": true, "available": true, "project_name": "Hometown Site", "full_course_available": true, "faq": "", "affiliates": [{"image": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/Wx1OdscqyJkXh3vYLx6ZTxngP542hK_P2Mew1MvItbCs-GF4a0lyBfFSOfebDt9CX4Fv-omaDshdYX_obLI9=s0#w=130&h=60", "name": "Google", "key": "google"}], "tracks": ["All", "Web Development"], "banner_image": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/J8GsTGwitRUPaZjR8bKP2H5Q3vGt3QOrlMTqeHwAXpYoLZFZuA7IedgQjV84wlYoWqX42M4Xb3SH3eyd_Ec=s0#w=4680&h=968", "short_summary": "Learn and practice strategies for developing websites that look great on every device!

We will request that you implement those suggestions to enhance your code and make it ready for the app store. Finally, to complete the course, you will submit your app to a Udacity coach for a thorough evaluation of your work.", "assistants": [], "new_release": true, "available": true, "project_name": "Make your first iPhone app", "full_course_available": true, "faq": "Before course development started, we asked you what questions you had about Apple's Swift language. Here are the answers to your most burning questions:\n\n### Why is the language called Swift?\nThe language was designed with two goals in mind: to be (1) swift to code, and (2) swift to execute. In terms of speed, Swift compiles Swift code to optimized native code depending on target device. In terms of learning curve, the Swift syntax was designed to be clean and easy to read. \n\n### Should I learn Swift or Objective-C?\nSwift! Apple has made it clear that Swift is the cornerstone of the future of iOS development. Plus, you can still utilize Objective-C files alongside Swift code, so you won\u2019t miss out on any pre-existing libraries and code.\n\n### How easy is Swift to learn?\nSwift was designed to be friendly for new programmers, and as a result it is incredibly easy to learn. <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/\">According to Apple</a>, Swift is the \u201cfirst industrial-quality systems programming language that is as expressive and enjoyable as a scripting language.\u201d Some have even <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/why-apples-swift-might-be-the-new-basic-and-thats-no-small-thing-7000030186/\" target=\"_blank\">called Swift the new BASIC</a>.\n\n### Is it fast?\n<a href=\"http://www.apple.com/swift/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple boasts</a> that Swift is up to 2.6x faster than Objective-C and 8.4x faster than Python 2.7. And why should you care about how quickly code executes? Well, faster running code makes for more efficient and smoother running apps, which makes for a better experience for your user.\n\n### Why did Apple decide to create a new language?\nObjective-C has been Apple\u2019s primary programming language for app writing since OS X was created. In that time, programming languages and practices changed drastically, especially in mobile development. Rather than adopt a new, already existing language, Apple created a new language tailored specifically for development on their own hardware.\n\n### Can I create an app in Swift and submit it to the App Store?\nAbsolutely! In fact, you were able to as soon as Xcode 6 and iOS 8 launched.\n\n### Why was there a need to go from Objective-C to Swift?\nAs mentioned in the answer to question five, after 20 years, Objective-C was starting to show it\u2019s age. Plus, Objective-C is a difficult language for new programmers to learn, so the barrier to entry is pretty high. Swift provides a modern language tailor-made for Apple hardware.\n\n### How Stable is Swift?\nAs with any new language, there is a potential for bugs. While you may encounter some trouble with the Swift language, the majority of issues were addressed before the 1.0 release.\n\nThe thing to most look out for is changes to the Swift language during each update. For example, when updating from 1.0 to 1.1, Apple introduced a new feature: <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=17\" target=\"_blank\">failable initializers</a>. You can expect that the language will change as more people use it and give feedback to Apple. Stay apprised of changes using the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/RevisionHistory.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH40-XID_1655\" target=\"_blank\">revision history for *The Swift Programming Language*</a>.\n\n### What other languages is it similar to?\nSwift is probably most similar in look and feel to Ruby or Python. Though you\u2019ll also probably recognize some C syntax. \n\n### Is it compatible with iOS 6 & 7?\nSwift can be run on iOS 7, but not iOS 6.", "affiliates": [], "tracks": ["All", "iOS"], "banner_image": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/6dnxW1q6Hip7w1eSqZgKYO2nbGAC9EZjDOHIoKnUu15EgFwTwVl6RLJpU24unfD3e3by9PsZcvWVRS1qrddb=s0#w=4680&h=968", "short_summary": "Take the first step in becoming an iOS Developer by learning about Swift and writing your first app.", "starter": false, "open_for_enrollment": true, "level": "intermediate", "expected_duration_unit": "months", "summary": "In this course we will build an iPhone app that records a conversation between you and a friend, and then makes your voices sound like a Chipmunk or Darth Vader.\n\nThis course will introduce you to iOS app development in Swift, a new programming language from Apple, and serves as your launching point into the [iOS Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/nd003).", "expected_duration": 1}, {"instructors": [{"bio": "Jonathan is redefining data science education as the co-founder and CTO of Zipfian Academy -- a 12-week full time immersive data science program.

You\u2019ll learn how to select elements on the page, add SVG elements, and how to style SVG elements. Make use of all the Instructor Notes throughout this lesson if you have little to no experience with HTML and CSS.\n\n### Mini-Project 1: RAW Visualization (2 hour)\nCreate a data visualization using a software of your choice. We will provide recommendations for visualization software as well as data sets. We want you to get right into making data visualization so here\u2019s your first chance!\n\n### Lesson 2a Design Principles (2 hours)\nWhich chart type should I use for my data? Which colors should I avoid when making graphics? How do I know if my graphic is effective? Investigate these questions, and learn about the World Cup data set which will be use throughout the rest of the course.\n\n### Lesson 2b Dimple.js (4 hours)\nLearn how to create graphics using the Dimple JavaScript library. You will learn about this library as a gentle coding introduction before learning about D3.js. You will be able to produce great graphics with minimal code, and all of your graphics will come with interactivity without any extra effort on your part. Dimple, it's simple!\n\n### Mini-Project 2: Take Two (2-5 hours)\nFind an existing data visualization, critique it for what it does well and what it doesn\u2019t do well, and finally, recreate the graphic using a software tool of your choice. We recommend using Dimple.js, which is covered in Lesson 2b, but we don\u2019t want you to feel constrained by the choice of tools. Use any tool that works for you.\n\n### Special Note\nAt this point in the course, you can start the final project.

What makes it special?  The ability to generate new features independently and on the fly.\n\n**Decision Trees:** Extremely straightforward, often just as accurate as an SVM but (usually) way faster.  The launch point for more sophisticated methods, like random forests and boosting.\n\n###Lesson 5: Datasets and Questions\nBehind any great machine learning project is a great dataset that the algorithm can learn from.  We were inspired by a treasure trove of email and financial data from the Enron corporation, which would normally be strictly confidential but became public when the company went bankrupt in a blizzard of fraud.  Follow our lead as we wrestle this dataset into a machine-learning-ready format, in anticipation of trying to predict cases of fraud.\n\n###Lesson 6 and 7: Regressions and Outliers\nRegressions are some of the most widely used machine learning algorithms, and rightly share prominence with classification.  What\u2019s a fast way to make mistakes in regression, though?  Have troublesome outliers in your data.  We\u2019ll tackle how to identify and clean away those pesky data points.\n\n###Lesson 8: Unsupervised Learning\n\n**K-Means Clustering:** The flagship algorithm when you don\u2019t have labeled data to work with, and a quick method for pattern-searching when approaching a dataset for the first time.\n\n###Lessons 9-12: Features, Features, Features\n\n**Feature Creation:** Taking your human intuition about the world and turning it into data that a computer can use.\n\n**Feature Selection:** Einstein said it best: make everything as simple as possible, and no simpler.  In this case, that means identifying the most important features of your data.\n\n**Principal Component Analysis:** A more sophisticated take on feature selection, and one of the crown jewels of unsupervised learning.\n\n**Feature Scaling:** Simple tricks for making sure your data and your algorithm play nicely together.\nLearning from Text: More information is in text than any other format, and there are some effective but simple tools for extracting that information.\n\n###Lessons 13-14: Validation and Evaluation\n\n**Training/testing data split:** How do you know that what you\u2019re doing is working?  You don\u2019t, unless you validate.  The train-test split is simple to do, and the gold standard for understanding your results.\n\n**Cross-validation:** Take the training/testing split and put it on steroids.  Validate your machine learning results like a pro.\n\n**Precision, recall, and F1 score:**  After all this data-driven work, quantify your results with metrics tailored to what is most important to you.\n \n###Lesson 15: Wrapping it all Up\nWe take a step back and review what we\u2019ve learned, and how it all fits together.  \n\n###Projects\n\nMini-project at the end of each lesson\n\n**Final project:** searching for signs of corporate fraud in Enron data", "assistants": [{"bio": "An experimental physicist by training, Katie first got interested in machine learning by using it to search for new particles like the Higgs boson.

You\u2019ll start using HTML (HyperText Markup Language) to format content for webpages. Then you\u2019ll get to see the mechanics of how the web works: HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) via GET and POST requests. In the first problem set, you will get a simple website up and running with the Google App Engine platform. \n\n###Lesson 2: Forms and Input (4 hours)\nIn this second lesson you will learn about forms, a very common way to obtain input from users. You will learn how to get and process user input from webpages using Google App Engine to get a live form up and running. By the end of this lesson, you will know how to validate user input and securely obtain data from users.\n\n\n###Lesson 3: Databases (6 hours)\nYou learned about getting all sorts of information from users in the previous lesson, but what do you do with it once it\u2019s in your hands? You store it! In this third lesson, Steve will dive in and teach you what you need to know about databases, the final piece you need to start setting your blog in motion! You will learn about various database technologies, SQL, and the Google App Engine Datastore.\n\n###Lesson 4: User Accounts and Security (6 hours)\nIn this fourth lesson, you will learn the fundamentals of authentication and security, which are very relevant topics in almost any web application built today. We\u2019ll start by examining how websites use cookies to authenticate users and how we can manage cookies from the backend of a web application. You will implement a login system for your blog and learn how to use hashing to securely read and transmit user passwords.\n\n###Lesson 5: APIs (4.5 hours)\nUp until now, your programs have generated HTML that a browser can use to render a web page for the user. In the digital world, however, applications and websites communicate not only with people, but also with other applications and websites. By the end of this lesson, your blog will communicate with humans as well as with other computers. Your web application can generate data in formats such as XML and JSON that other computers can access through an API, or application programming interface. Those computers, in turn, can build websites or services that interact with your data. You\u2019ll first learn how to use APIs, and then build web applications as services so that other computers can glean data from your application. We will look at both XML and JSON by investigating how to read them, how to interpret them, and how to manipulate them. \n\n###Lesson 6: Caching (3.5 hours)\nIn this lesson, we will explore how to prepare your applications to run at a large scale. So far, we've written 'toy' applications for just one or two users. If we want to start writing apps for thousands or, perhaps, even millions of users, then obviously we'll need to think about scaling. When we talk about scaling, this may mean running your application on multiple machines, storing huge amounts of data, or consuming large amounts of bandwidth. In particular, we will learn about caching, including the uses of caching, why you might want to cache, and specific caching implementations such as Memcached. \n\n###Lesson 7: Scaling Up (2.5 hours)\nIn this last lesson of the course, Steve has prepared a relaxing, story-time segment. You will hear web development anecdotes from people who have been through it all. You will enjoy interviews with engineer Neil Williams from Reddit, and engineer Chris Chew from Udacity. They will share their experiences on working with web applications, and you will see how all that you\u2019ve learned in this course comes into the big picture.\n\n###Final Project (8 hours)\nFor the final project, you will build a fully functional wiki - a website that allows any page to be edited. The wiki you will be able to build by the end of the course will feature the following: \n\n- Easily create new pages of the site by using the wiki edit capabilities. You should be able to enter a non-existent URL, redirect to an edit page, and create a new page from there. \n- Have user accounts so that logged-in users only will have edit privileges. \n- Use caching functionality.\n- Have a history section which displays the different wiki versions that have existed.", "assistants": [{"bio": "Sean Bennett is a Course Architect at Udacity and is passionate about using the web to improve the quality of education available worldwide.

You\u2019ll learn how the value of \u201cthis\u201d is determined within various code structures and why it might be a lot easier to think of \u201cthis\u201d as a parameter rather than a keyword.\n\n### Lesson 3: Prototype Delegation\nYou\u2019re probably using one of JavaScript\u2019s inheritance models already: prototype delegation! In this lesson you\u2019ll learn more about this unique feature of JavaScript, how JavaScript uses this feature internally and how you can take advantage of it to maximize your application\u2019s memory footprint.\n\n### Lesson 4: Code Reuse\nThere are numerous ways to write concise, maintainable and reusable code in JavaScript and you\u2019ll practice a number of them in this lesson. We\u2019ll start writing a library using basic functions and learn the decorator pattern. Then, we\u2019ll refactor this library into the functional, prototypal and pseudoclassical inheritance models.

(1 hour)\nWe'll start by learn about what exploratory data analysis (EDA) is and why it is important. You'll meet the amazing instructors for the course and find out about the course structure and final project.\n\n### Lesson 2: R Basics (3 hours)\nEDA, which comes before formal hypothesis testing and modeling, makes use of visual methods to analyze and summarize data sets. R will be our tool for generating those visuals and conducting analyses. In this lesson, we will install RStudio and packages, learn the layout and basic commands of R, practice writing basic R scripts, and inspect data sets.\n\n### Lesson 3: Explore One Variable (4 hours)\nWe perform EDA to understand the distribution of a variable and to check for anomalies and outliers. Learn how to quantify and visualize individual variables within a data set as we begin to make sense of a pseudo-data set of Facebook users. While the data set does not contain real user data, it does contain a wealth of information. Through the lesson, we will create histograms and boxplots, transform variables, and examine tradeoffs in visualizations.\n\n### Problem Set 3 (2 hours)\n\n### Lesson 4: Explore Two Variables (4 hours)\nEDA allows us to identify the most important variables and relationships within a data set before building predictive models. In this lesson, we will learn techniques for exploring the relationship between any two variables in a data set. We'll create scatter plots, calculate correlations, and investigate conditional means.\n\n### Problem Set 4 (2 hours)\n\n### Lesson 5: Explore Many Variables (4 hours)\nData sets can be complex. In this lesson, we will learn powerful methods and visualizations for examining relationships among multiple variables. We'll learn how to reshape data frames and how to use aesthetics like color and shape to uncover more information. Extending our knowledge of previous plots, we'll continue to build intuition around the Facebook data set and explore some new data sets as well.\n\n### Problem Set 5 (2 hours)\n\n### Lesson 6: Diamonds and Price Predictions (2 hours)\nInvestigate the diamonds data set alongside Facebook Data Scientist, Solomon Messing. He'll recap many of the strategies covered in the course and show how predictive modeling can allow us to determine a good price for a diamond. As a final project, you will create your own exploratory data analysis on a data set of your choice.\n\n### Final Project (10+ hours)\nYou've explored simulated Facebook user data and the diamonds data set.

In Lessons 1 and 2, you will learn widely applicable design principles and techniques like high-level UX planning and user-centered design.\n\nIn Lessons 3 and 4, you will focus on design ideas specific to mobile/Android development. Mobile platforms all come with a unique set of constraints and opportunities and this lesson will help you respect those constraints while taking advantage of the opportunities. \n\n### Lessons\n\n#### Lesson 1: What is User Experience?\nIn this lesson you will think about User Experience from the highest level. You will break down complex apps into a small number of simple steps and think about their big picture flow (including ones that you have worked on in the past or are currently working on). \n\n*Topics covered:*\n\n* What is UX?\n* UI vs. UX\n* High-level planning\n* Low-fi wireframing and prototyping\n* Two concrete app improvements to implement now\n\n#### Lesson 2: User-Centered Design\nIn this lesson you will learn how to design apps that your users will love. You will learn the importance of user-centered design, what happens when you design for everyone/no one (spoiler alert: it\u2019s generally bad), and how to effectively use tools like personas and use cases to ensure a baseline level of quality for anything you build. You will also learn a bit about how to use cheap and easy user research techniques to make well-informed design decisions. \n\n*Topics covered:*\n\n* The perils of ignoring your user\n* How to create effective personas and use cases\n* Low cost user research\n* How to use personas and use cases to inform feature lists\n\n#### Lesson 3: Designing for Mobile Constraints\n\nMobile design and development come with constraints and opportunities. This lesson is about the constraints. You will learn what constraints are inherent to mobile development and how to use design tools and techniques to ensure your app actually respects those constraints. \n\n*Topics covered:*\n\n* The 5 big constraints: limited data, finite battery, hand-held usage, divided user attention, and small screens.\n* The implications of these constraints and what happens when you get them wrong.\n* Advanced wireframing\n\n#### Lesson 4: Designing for Android Delight\n\nAt this point, you will already know how to make a solid mobile app that users like. But like isn\u2019t enough! In order to be really successful, your app needs to be *loved*. In this lesson, you\u2019ll learn how to leverage the power of Android by using device sensors and Google APIs to understand your user\u2019s context.\n\n*Topics covered:*\n\n* Android sensors\n* The importance of contextual apps\n* The \u201ccomponents\u201d of context\n* Android APIs (Google Play Services)\n\n### Final Project\nIn your final project, you will create high/mid-level design specifications for your own incredible Android app. You'll begin work on this project in the Assignments for Lesson 2, and continue working on it until the end of the course. \n\nWhen it's finished, you will have the blueprint for an app that will:\n\n* Be designed for a specific target user.\n* Have an almost-perfect high level flow.\n* Avoid all major mobile pitfalls.\n* Use Android sensors and APIs to understand your user's context and deliver context-aware moments of amazement that they will love.", "assistants": [{"bio": "Andy Brown is a Lead Instructor at Udacity.

You'll learn the ins and outs of point-and-click development, so all you need now is an interest in building an app.\n\nOne thing you should know: the skills you learn in this course are in high demand and will help further your career.", "syllabus": "### Overview\nIn this class you\u2019ll learn the basics of building apps with Force.com, a part of Salesforce Platform. These apps are typically business apps: they solve organizational and logistical problems. You probably wouldn\u2019t use Salesforce to build a computer game (though you could!).\n\nThere are two ways to build apps in Force.com: with or without code. This class will only cover the non-coding, point-and-click app building interface. But don\u2019t be fooled! Building powerful apps does not require writing code. \n\nThis class contains an introductory lesson, five primary lessons where you'll be building and learning (each of which has an accompanying problem set to practice your skills), and a final project where you'll put everything together.\n\n### Lesson 0: What is Salesforce (15 mins)\nWhat **is** Salesforce Platform? What does it do? Why should I learn about it? What kind of jobs can I get after I learn how to use it?\n\nIn this lesson, you\u2019ll meet the instructors, get to know the class, and learn a bit about Salesforce in general. \n\n### Lesson 1: Creating your First App (90 minutes)\nIn this lesson you\u2019ll get acquainted with Force.com and actually build the beginnings of your first app. You\u2019ll get some experience taking a big problem (in this case, managing a music festival), breaking it into smaller parts, and representing those parts in Salesforce. As you do this, you\u2019ll learn about the basic components of a Salesforce app and add some simple (but powerful) functionality to your app. More concretely, you\u2019ll learn about:\n\n* **Salesforce Data**: Salesforce represents data as objects, fields, and records. You\u2019ll learn what these terms mean and build them into your app. \n* **Relationships**: When the pieces of your app start communicating, interesting things can happen. In this lesson you\u2019ll learn the basics of Salesforce relationship fields. \n* **Validation Rules**: If you\u2019ve ever incorrectly entered your credit card number into a website, you already know about validation rules. In this lesson, you\u2019ll learn how to build them into your app. \n* **Formulas and Summaries**: These tools let you easily keep track of quantifiable things like money spent, customers contacted, or tickets sold. In this lesson you\u2019ll learn how to build these automated calculations into your app.  \n\n### Lesson 2: Building out your Data Model (90 mins)\nBehind every powerful business app is a well-planned data model (also known as a schema). In this lesson you\u2019ll learn how to decompose a complex problem into its component pieces and then connect those pieces together with the appropriate relationship fields. The data model you build will serve as the schematic skeleton onto which you\u2019ll build dynamic functionality in later lessons. The specific topics covered are: \n\n* **One-to-Many Relationships**: These relationships let the pieces of your app talk to each other. In this lesson you\u2019ll learn how and when (and why) to use master-detail and lookup relationships in the apps you build. \n* **Many-to-Many Relationships**: You\u2019ll learn how to use a junction object to add flexibility into your data model. \n* **Customizing the User Interface**: Good apps should be easy to use! In this lesson you\u2019ll learn how to configure the layout of your app to make sure the UI is simple and intuitive.\n* **Schema Builder**: There are many ways to get things done in Salesforce. In this lesson you\u2019ll start using the schema builder to understand how your app works.\n* **Data Loading**: This is a convenient way to get lots of data onto your app at once.\n\n### Lesson 3: Visualizing your Data (45 mins) \nNo matter what kind of app you\u2019re building, you\u2019ve probably got some data that you want other people in your organization to understand quickly and easily. In this lesson you\u2019ll learn how quickly communicate information with  real-time data visualizations. Specifically, you\u2019ll learn how to make:\n\n* **Reports**: These let you gather related information into one place.  These let you gather data according to specific criteria and display it in neat rows and columns. \n* **Charts**: These let you graphically summarize the information in a report.\n* **Dashboards**: Different people want access to different information. A dashboard is a collection of charts that give specific people in your organization exactly the information that they need in real-time.\n* **Views**: Data is good, but sometimes you have too much. Views let you selectively and quickly display only the data you care about.\n\n### Lesson 4: Adding Automation (45 mins)\nIn this lesson you\u2019ll think about how to use your app to automate manual tasks. You\u2019ll learn how to use two important Salesforce tools: \n\n* **Workflows**: There are situations where a series of steps need to happen in sequence: first do this, then do that. Workflows let you automate processes like these, such as sending an email, assigning a task, or updating a field.\n* **Approval Processes**: You don\u2019t want every job to be completely automated. Sometimes you need someone to step in and say \u201cthis looks good.\u201d Approval processes add a human element to your automated tasks.\n\n### Lesson 5: Make it Social. Make it Mobile. (45 mins)\nThis is it. With a few clicks of the mouse you\u2019ll make your app social and mobile. The tools you\u2019ll use are:\n\n* **Chatter**: This will let your users collaborate on the projects and records they work on together.  \n* **Salesforce1**: That web app you\u2019ve been building this whole time? It\u2019s actually a mobile app too. You\u2019ll even learn how to quickly customize your mobile interface and add functionality for mobile productivity. \n\n### Final Project: Build your own App (2-4 hours)\nBy the time you get here, you will have already built a music festival management app. Now it\u2019s time to take your own idea and turn it into a functional web and mobile app.", "assistants": [], "new_release": false, "available": true, "project_name": "Create Your Own Salesforce App", "full_course_available": true, "faq": "", "affiliates": [{"image": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/nr4_Gfu9oiAipeZOVzsizRT14K3QE2_qil8L11BdaXaLUbEnLn17DDNy8pabYlYbofw9wcyyETcI3ETr5b4=s0#w=130&h=60", "name": "Salesforce", "key": "Salesforce"}], "tracks": ["All", "Web Development"], "banner_image": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/NaWEGnVTrwLQwzIzNM7m0uQCu1hv0nJL3Y12-F_Ml8iOUxA4Y1ozHrYnokYsPhLq9fCSwuoO3h9hUoqm00I=s0#w=4680&h=968", "short_summary": "In this short class you'll build powerful apps without writing code.

If you ever find that you\u2019re confused, you can always go back and watch something that you skipped.\n\n### How much does this cost?\n\n It\u2019s completely free! If you\u2019re feeling generous, we would love to have you contribute your thoughts, questions, and answers to the course discussion forum.\n\n### What are the rules on collaboration?\n\n Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. \n\n### Why are there so many questions?\n\n Udacity classes are a little different from traditional courses. We intersperse our video segments with interactive questions. There are many reasons for including these questions: to get you thinking, to check your understanding, for fun, etc... But really, they are there to help you learn. They are NOT there to evaluate your intelligence, so try not to let them stress you out.\n\n### What should I do while I\u2019m watching the videos?\n\n Learn actively!

There are countless ways to start. And as a novice, it's hard to even know what you actually need to learn. This barrier to entry prevents many people from learning the life-changing skill of programming. \n\nThis Nanodegree is meant to remove that barrier by providing a simple path to the knowledge, skills, and ways of thinking that programmers in any field use all the time. \n\nAfter completing this Nanodegree you will not be an an expert programmer. But you will know enough to be dangerous and you'll have the power to make an informed choice about what you want to do next. You may decide to pursue a career in tech or you may be satisfied with the technical literacy, programming skills and mindsets you've developed. \n\nRegardless of your choice, you will be changed in three important ways.\n\n1. **You will have new knowledge**. This new knowledge will let you communicate effectively with professional programmers, teach your friends and family how the internet works, and understand the most important concepts in programming.\n2. **You will have new skills**. These skills will let you build web pages that others can use, automate repetitive tasks in your life, and quickly find the appropriate educational resources for whatever programming skills you choose to learn in the future.\n3. **You will have new ways of thinking**. This Nanodegree will focus on five thinking styles that programmers use all the time. Once you've acquired them, you'll find that \"thinking like a programmer\" gives you a new set of tools for thinking about areas of your life that may have nothing to do with programming at all.", "featured": false, "capped": false, "teaser_video": {"youtube_url": "", "transcodings": {}}, "title": "Introduction to Programming Nanodegree", "expected_duration_low": 4, "required_knowledge": "This Nanodegree is meant for someone with no technical background.", "syllabus": "## What You Will Build\n\nAs you progress through this Nanodegree you will document what you're learning in a web page that you'll build as you go. By the end you will have a fully-functioning web page to share with your friends and family. This web page will:\n\n### Look Professional\nBy using a \"styling\" language called CSS, you will be able to quickly and easily change the look and feel of your web page. While learning CSS, you'll also gain experience with one of the most important concepts in computer science: avoiding repetition through something called *abstraction*. \n\n### Display Videos\nIn addition to your own notes about what you're learning, you'll learn to write computer code in a language called Python that will embed your favorite videos (from Udacity or anywhere else) directly onto your web page. While learning  Python, you'll be developing a skill that's required for every programming project regardless of language: using procedural thinking to tell a computer exactly what you want it to do.\n\n\n### Be User-Friendly\nEven though *you* will have the skills to modify your web page by changing the code it's made from, the people you show it to may not. You'll add a form that allows visitors to add their own content to your page (if you let them of course). While you're learning what to do with information that someone submits to your web page, you'll also gain a deeper understanding for how the internet works and how computer programmers assemble complex programs by combining pieces of computer code that others have written before them. \n\n## How You Will Learn to Build it\n\nThis Nanodegree consists of a series of 5 courses. In each one, you will learn new broadly-applicable technical skills. After each course, you will complete a project checkpoint, where you apply your new skills by adding functionality to your web page, then submit your work for valuable feedback on your progress.  \n\n### Course 1: A Web of Structured Documents\nYou will learn the basics of how the internet works and how documents written in a language called HTML form the backbone of the Web. In the **project checkpoint** at the end you'll *write HTML and CSS (another language) to make your web page look professional.*\n\n### Course 2: Telling Computers What to Do\nThis is the course where you'll learn how to program. You'll learn a programming language called Python and you'll use it to write instructions that the computer can understand and execute. After this course you will have incredible power: you will be able to automate almost any repetitive task that can be done on a computer. In the **project checkpoint** you will *write a program that automatically makes web pages.*\n\n### Course 3: The Power of Reusing Code\nIn this course you will learn an entirely new approach to programming (and thinking) called Object Oriented Programming and how to use this approach to build impressive programs by simply reusing or modifying computer code that others have already written. In the **project checkpoint**, you will *embed YouTube videos directly into your web site.*\n\n### Course 4: Working with the Full Stack\nUp to this point, you still haven't put your web page online: you've only seen it on your own computer. In this course, you will gain a deeper understanding for how the internet works and will write code which tells computers called \"servers\" how to display web pages. In the **project checkpoint** you will *put your web page online and build what's called a \"back end\" which will allow people anywhere in the world to view and--if you let them--modify your site.*\n\n### Course 5: The Rest of the Programming World\nAt this point, you will already have a solid understanding of most of the essential concepts and skills that programming requires. This course will be a rapid sampling of some of the ideas that you haven't seen. You'll be introduced to ideas around topics like:\n\n* algorithms\n* efficiency\n* what makes code \"good\"\n* what it's like to work as a programmer\n* programming for mobile devices\n\nAnd more. In the **project checkpoint** you will *pursue one of these ideas even deeper by adding new functionality (you get to choose what) to your web page.*", "assistants": [], "new_release": true, "available": true, "project_name": "", "full_course_available": true, "faq": "", "affiliates": [], "tracks": ["All"], "banner_image": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/Fnv18TpBOzfB9_tRdymjvTY4pwwiiYlgcC86vaZrIVNbHcqR6FAtypjbZlRsL2CijQE5VuF-Y8ehmi8vJA=s0#w=4680&h=968", "short_summary": "Welcome to the world of programming.

More specifically, we will talk about the projects we will build and the ideas we will learn in this course. Then we will conduct a short test to ensure you have all the prerequisites necessary for the course. Finally, we will work together to download Python on your computer.\n\n### Lesson 1: Using Functions (3.5 hours)\nWe will use functions (webbrowser.open and os.rename) from the Python Standard Library to build two projects in this lesson. After that we will present a scenario where using functions will not present a very elegant solution; this will illuminate the need for a new programming tool called Classes.\n\n### Lesson 2: Using Classes (5 hours)\nHere we will learn about important object-oriented programming concepts like classes and instances. We will build three cool projects while using classes. These include drawing shapes with Turtle, sending text messages with Twilio and checking curse words with a function called open.\n\nWe will leverage modules from within the Python Standard Library and also learn to download and use an external Python package (twilio).\n\n### Lesson 3: Making Classes (5 hours)\nIn this lesson we will learn to create our first class. While doing this we will build a website that plays trailers of your favorite movies. Here are some of the programming ideas we will learn in this lesson:\n\n- How to create a class\n- How to instantiate an object\n- How to access class attributes and methods \n- What is the self keyword\n- What are constructors (\\__init__)\n- What are DocStrings\n- How to create and access Class Variables\n- How does Inheritance work\n- How to override methods  \n\n### Final Project (6 hours)\nHere, you will use the skills learned in this course to identify a problem statement and idea for a project.

What kinds of devices should we be targeting with our design? How can we best leverage the different capabilities of each device to provide great experiences to users? You\u2019ll also make sure that your development environment is ready to go. \n\n<strong>Topics covered:</strong>\n\n* What is responsive design?\n* Why does responsive design work for any device?\n* Remote debugging and emulation in the browser\n\n### Lesson 2 - Starting Small\nThe best way to get started is to start small and build up. In this lesson, we\u2019ll cover the key components that make a site great on a small screen, including setting the viewport, adding content and sizing the content to the viewport.  You\u2019ll start the home town site project, by making sure that it looks good on a small screen.  \n\n<strong>Topics covered:</strong>\n\n* Why start small and build up?\n* What is the viewport?\n* Sizing content the content to the viewport\n  * avoiding static sized items\n* Touch targets, and why they should be large\n\n### Lesson 3 - Building Up\nOnce you\u2019ve got a page optimized for small screens, it\u2019s time to start thinking about how they\u2019ll look on larger screens.  Learn how to use CSS media queries to add breakpoints that change the layout depending on the screen size or other device characteristics.\n\n<strong>Topics covered:</strong>\n\n* CSS media queries\n* What is a breakpoint, and how to choose one\n* Using the CSS flexbox to modify layout\n\n### Lesson 4 - Common Responsive Patterns\nNow that you\u2019ve got the basics of responsive design down, you\u2019ll learn about and practice some of the common layout design patterns used across sites. You'll also iterate on the home town site project, creating breakpoints for tablet and desktop layouts using the patterns from this lesson.\n\n<strong>Topics covered:</strong>\n\n* Mostly fluid pattern\n* Column drop pattern\n* Layout shifter pattern\n* Off canvas pattern\n\n### Lesson 5 - Optimizations\nLearn strategies for minor breakpoints used to adjust the margins or padding on an element, or increase the font size to make it feel more natural in the layout. You\u2019ll also learn about strategies for dealing with tables and optimal text readability. At the end of the lesson, you'll iterate for the last time on the home town site, adding minor breakpoints to really make the experience stand out.\n\n<strong>Topics covered:</strong>\n\n* Minor break points\n* Optimizing text layout\n  * font size\n  * optimal line length\n* Responsive tables, and strategies for dealing with them", "assistants": [], "new_release": true, "available": true, "project_name": "Hometown Site", "full_course_available": true, "faq": "", "affiliates": [{"image": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/Wx1OdscqyJkXh3vYLx6ZTxngP542hK_P2Mew1MvItbCs-GF4a0lyBfFSOfebDt9CX4Fv-omaDshdYX_obLI9=s0#w=130&h=60", "name": "Google", "key": "google"}], "tracks": ["All", "Web Development"], "banner_image": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/J8GsTGwitRUPaZjR8bKP2H5Q3vGt3QOrlMTqeHwAXpYoLZFZuA7IedgQjV84wlYoWqX42M4Xb3SH3eyd_Ec=s0#w=4680&h=968", "short_summary": "Learn and practice strategies for developing websites that look great on every device!

Here are the answers to your most burning questions:\n\n### Why is the language called Swift?\nThe language was designed with two goals in mind: to be (1) swift to code, and (2) swift to execute. In terms of speed, Swift compiles Swift code to optimized native code depending on target device. In terms of learning curve, the Swift syntax was designed to be clean and easy to read. \n\n### Should I learn Swift or Objective-C?\nSwift! Apple has made it clear that Swift is the cornerstone of the future of iOS development. Plus, you can still utilize Objective-C files alongside Swift code, so you won\u2019t miss out on any pre-existing libraries and code.\n\n### How easy is Swift to learn?\nSwift was designed to be friendly for new programmers, and as a result it is incredibly easy to learn. <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/\">According to Apple</a>, Swift is the \u201cfirst industrial-quality systems programming language that is as expressive and enjoyable as a scripting language.\u201d Some have even <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/why-apples-swift-might-be-the-new-basic-and-thats-no-small-thing-7000030186/\" target=\"_blank\">called Swift the new BASIC</a>.\n\n### Is it fast?\n<a href=\"http://www.apple.com/swift/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple boasts</a> that Swift is up to 2.6x faster than Objective-C and 8.4x faster than Python 2.7. And why should you care about how quickly code executes? Well, faster running code makes for more efficient and smoother running apps, which makes for a better experience for your user.\n\n### Why did Apple decide to create a new language?\nObjective-C has been Apple\u2019s primary programming language for app writing since OS X was created. In that time, programming languages and practices changed drastically, especially in mobile development. Rather than adopt a new, already existing language, Apple created a new language tailored specifically for development on their own hardware.\n\n### Can I create an app in Swift and submit it to the App Store?\nAbsolutely! In fact, you were able to as soon as Xcode 6 and iOS 8 launched.\n\n### Why was there a need to go from Objective-C to Swift?\nAs mentioned in the answer to question five, after 20 years, Objective-C was starting to show it\u2019s age. Plus, Objective-C is a difficult language for new programmers to learn, so the barrier to entry is pretty high. Swift provides a modern language tailor-made for Apple hardware.\n\n### How Stable is Swift?\nAs with any new language, there is a potential for bugs. While you may encounter some trouble with the Swift language, the majority of issues were addressed before the 1.0 release.\n\nThe thing to most look out for is changes to the Swift language during each update. For example, when updating from 1.0 to 1.1, Apple introduced a new feature: <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=17\" target=\"_blank\">failable initializers</a>. You can expect that the language will change as more people use it and give feedback to Apple. Stay apprised of changes using the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/RevisionHistory.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH40-XID_1655\" target=\"_blank\">revision history for *The Swift Programming Language*</a>.\n\n### What other languages is it similar to?\nSwift is probably most similar in look and feel to Ruby or Python. Though you\u2019ll also probably recognize some C syntax. \n\n### Is it compatible with iOS 6 & 7?\nSwift can be run on iOS 7, but not iOS 6.", "affiliates": [], "tracks": ["All", "iOS"], "banner_image": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/6dnxW1q6Hip7w1eSqZgKYO2nbGAC9EZjDOHIoKnUu15EgFwTwVl6RLJpU24unfD3e3by9PsZcvWVRS1qrddb=s0#w=4680&h=968", "short_summary": "Take the first step in becoming an iOS Developer by learning about Swift and writing your first app.", "starter": false, "open_for_enrollment": true, "level": "intermediate", "expected_duration_unit": "months", "summary": "In this course we will build an iPhone app that records a conversation between you and a friend, and then makes your voices sound like a Chipmunk or Darth Vader.\n\nThis course will introduce you to iOS app development in Swift, a new programming language from Apple, and serves as your launching point into the [iOS Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/nd003).", "expected_duration": 1}, {"instructors": [{"bio": "Jonathan is redefining data science education as the co-founder and CTO of Zipfian Academy -- a 12-week full time immersive data science program.

This course also make use of open web standards (HTML, CSS, and SVG) to create data visualizations.\n\n### You can also learn how to...\n\n- communicate clearly with the best visual representation of your data\n- tell stories, spark discussion, and create calls to actions for readers\n- design graphics like ones from the NYTimes and other media companies\n- how to use open web technologies to create an online portfolio of your work\n- use visualization libraries (<a href=\"http://dimplejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">dimple.js</a> and <a href=\"http://d3js.org/\" target=\"_blank\">D3.js</a>) to create graphics\n\n### Final Project: Making an Effective Data Visualization (2 hours or more)\nYou will create a data visualization that conveys a clear message about a data set. You will use dimple.js or d3.js and collect feedback along the way to arrive at a polished product.", "featured": false, "capped": true, "teaser_video": {"youtube_url": "", "transcodings": {}}, "title": "Data Visualization and D3.js", "expected_duration_low": 7, "required_knowledge": "Regardless of your programming background, you can learn about data visualization and design principles in Lesson 1a and Lesson 2a without the following recommended background.\n\nTo succeed in this course, you should to be familiar with basic programming principles, including data types (strings, arrays, booleans, etc.), `if else` statements, and `for` loops. You should also be able to describe concepts like functions and objects. Our <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101\" target=\"_blank\">Intro to Computer Science</a> and <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/ud036\" target=\"_blank\">Programming Fundamentals with Python</a> courses are great places to get started.\n\nBasic knowledge of HTML and CSS (structuring and styling a web page) is not required but highly recommended. We suggest taking the <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/ud304\" target=\"_blank\">Intro to HTML and CSS</a> course if you have no experience with HTML or CSS.\n\nThis course is unique in that the final project can be completed using either dimple.js or d3.js. The visualization library, dimple.js, is easier to use than d3.js and requires less background knowledge. Furthermore, a graphic can be created in considerably fewer lines of code using dimple.js as opposed to d3.js.\n\nSo why should you learn d3.js?\n\nData Driven Documents (d3.js) allows you to build highly customized graphics. If you would like to gain more technical skills and learn more about Javascript and open web standards, then you should complete Lesson 3 and Lesson 4 in order to prepare for the final project.\n\n\nIf you would like to complete the final project using d3.js, you should have some experience reading and using documentation. For example, you should be able to code a `for` loop in Javascript or be able to look up the syntax to work with strings and arrays in Javascript. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/ud804\" target=\"_blank\">Javascript Basics</a> course if you have little to no experience with Javascript.", "syllabus": "### Lesson 1a Visualization Fundamentals (2 hour)\nLearn about the elements of great data visualization. In this lesson, you will meet data visualization experts, learn about data visualization in the context of data science, and learn how to represent data values in visual form.\n\n### Lesson 1b D3 Building Blocks (4 hours)\nLearn how to use the open standards of the web to create graphical elements. You\u2019ll learn how to select elements on the page, add SVG elements, and how to style SVG elements. Make use of all the Instructor Notes throughout this lesson if you have little to no experience with HTML and CSS.\n\n### Mini-Project 1: RAW Visualization (2 hour)\nCreate a data visualization using a software of your choice. We will provide recommendations for visualization software as well as data sets. We want you to get right into making data visualization so here\u2019s your first chance!\n\n### Lesson 2a Design Principles (2 hours)\nWhich chart type should I use for my data? Which colors should I avoid when making graphics? How do I know if my graphic is effective? Investigate these questions, and learn about the World Cup data set which will be use throughout the rest of the course.\n\n### Lesson 2b Dimple.js (4 hours)\nLearn how to create graphics using the Dimple JavaScript library. You will learn about this library as a gentle coding introduction before learning about D3.js. You will be able to produce great graphics with minimal code, and all of your graphics will come with interactivity without any extra effort on your part. Dimple, it's simple!\n\n### Mini-Project 2: Take Two (2-5 hours)\nFind an existing data visualization, critique it for what it does well and what it doesn\u2019t do well, and finally, recreate the graphic using a software tool of your choice. We recommend using Dimple.js, which is covered in Lesson 2b, but we don\u2019t want you to feel constrained by the choice of tools. Use any tool that works for you.\n\n### Special Note\nAt this point in the course, you can start the final project. The remaining content of the course covers narrative structures, types of bias, and maps. All of the code  in Lesson 3 and Lesson 4 pertains to d3.js. If you'd like to learn d3.js and complete the final project using d3.js, then please continue. If you prefer to stop, you can complete the final project using dimple.js.\n\n### Lesson 3 Narratives (5 hours)\nLearn how to incorporate different narrative structures into your visualizations and code along with Jonathan as you create a graphic for the World Cup data set. You\u2019ll learn about different types of bias in the data visualization process and learn how to add context to your data visualizations. By the end of this lesson, you\u2019ll have a solid foundation in D3.js.\n\n### Lesson 4 Animation and Interaction (5 hours)\nStatic graphics are great, but interactive graphics can be even better. Learn how to leverage animation and interaction to bring more data insights to your audience. Code along with Jonathan once again as you learn how to create a bubble map for the World Cup data set.\n\n### Final Project: Making an Effective Data Visualization (2 hours or more)\nCreate an explanatory graphic that incorporates animation or interaction using dimple.js or d3.js.", "assistants": [{"bio": "After graduating from Emory in 2008, Chris dabbled in college admissions for a year, which led him to teach high school mathematics in Oakland.

What makes it special?  The ability to generate new features independently and on the fly.\n\n**Decision Trees:** Extremely straightforward, often just as accurate as an SVM but (usually) way faster.  The launch point for more sophisticated methods, like random forests and boosting.\n\n###Lesson 5: Datasets and Questions\nBehind any great machine learning project is a great dataset that the algorithm can learn from.  We were inspired by a treasure trove of email and financial data from the Enron corporation, which would normally be strictly confidential but became public when the company went bankrupt in a blizzard of fraud.  Follow our lead as we wrestle this dataset into a machine-learning-ready format, in anticipation of trying to predict cases of fraud.\n\n###Lesson 6 and 7: Regressions and Outliers\nRegressions are some of the most widely used machine learning algorithms, and rightly share prominence with classification.  What\u2019s a fast way to make mistakes in regression, though?  Have troublesome outliers in your data.  We\u2019ll tackle how to identify and clean away those pesky data points.\n\n###Lesson 8: Unsupervised Learning\n\n**K-Means Clustering:** The flagship algorithm when you don\u2019t have labeled data to work with, and a quick method for pattern-searching when approaching a dataset for the first time.\n\n###Lessons 9-12: Features, Features, Features\n\n**Feature Creation:** Taking your human intuition about the world and turning it into data that a computer can use.\n\n**Feature Selection:** Einstein said it best: make everything as simple as possible, and no simpler.  In this case, that means identifying the most important features of your data.\n\n**Principal Component Analysis:** A more sophisticated take on feature selection, and one of the crown jewels of unsupervised learning.\n\n**Feature Scaling:** Simple tricks for making sure your data and your algorithm play nicely together.\nLearning from Text: More information is in text than any other format, and there are some effective but simple tools for extracting that information.\n\n###Lessons 13-14: Validation and Evaluation\n\n**Training/testing data split:** How do you know that what you\u2019re doing is working?  You don\u2019t, unless you validate.  The train-test split is simple to do, and the gold standard for understanding your results.\n\n**Cross-validation:** Take the training/testing split and put it on steroids.  Validate your machine learning results like a pro.\n\n**Precision, recall, and F1 score:**  After all this data-driven work, quantify your results with metrics tailored to what is most important to you.\n \n###Lesson 15: Wrapping it all Up\nWe take a step back and review what we\u2019ve learned, and how it all fits together.  \n\n###Projects\n\nMini-project at the end of each lesson\n\n**Final project:** searching for signs of corporate fraud in Enron data", "assistants": [{"bio": "An experimental physicist by training, Katie first got interested in machine learning by using it to search for new particles like the Higgs boson.

You\u2019ll start using HTML (HyperText Markup Language) to format content for webpages. Then you\u2019ll get to see the mechanics of how the web works: HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) via GET and POST requests. In the first problem set, you will get a simple website up and running with the Google App Engine platform. \n\n###Lesson 2: Forms and Input (4 hours)\nIn this second lesson you will learn about forms, a very common way to obtain input from users. You will learn how to get and process user input from webpages using Google App Engine to get a live form up and running. By the end of this lesson, you will know how to validate user input and securely obtain data from users.\n\n\n###Lesson 3: Databases (6 hours)\nYou learned about getting all sorts of information from users in the previous lesson, but what do you do with it once it\u2019s in your hands? You store it! In this third lesson, Steve will dive in and teach you what you need to know about databases, the final piece you need to start setting your blog in motion! You will learn about various database technologies, SQL, and the Google App Engine Datastore.\n\n###Lesson 4: User Accounts and Security (6 hours)\nIn this fourth lesson, you will learn the fundamentals of authentication and security, which are very relevant topics in almost any web application built today. We\u2019ll start by examining how websites use cookies to authenticate users and how we can manage cookies from the backend of a web application. You will implement a login system for your blog and learn how to use hashing to securely read and transmit user passwords.\n\n###Lesson 5: APIs (4.5 hours)\nUp until now, your programs have generated HTML that a browser can use to render a web page for the user. In the digital world, however, applications and websites communicate not only with people, but also with other applications and websites. By the end of this lesson, your blog will communicate with humans as well as with other computers. Your web application can generate data in formats such as XML and JSON that other computers can access through an API, or application programming interface. Those computers, in turn, can build websites or services that interact with your data. You\u2019ll first learn how to use APIs, and then build web applications as services so that other computers can glean data from your application. We will look at both XML and JSON by investigating how to read them, how to interpret them, and how to manipulate them. \n\n###Lesson 6: Caching (3.5 hours)\nIn this lesson, we will explore how to prepare your applications to run at a large scale. So far, we've written 'toy' applications for just one or two users. If we want to start writing apps for thousands or, perhaps, even millions of users, then obviously we'll need to think about scaling. When we talk about scaling, this may mean running your application on multiple machines, storing huge amounts of data, or consuming large amounts of bandwidth. In particular, we will learn about caching, including the uses of caching, why you might want to cache, and specific caching implementations such as Memcached. \n\n###Lesson 7: Scaling Up (2.5 hours)\nIn this last lesson of the course, Steve has prepared a relaxing, story-time segment. You will hear web development anecdotes from people who have been through it all. You will enjoy interviews with engineer Neil Williams from Reddit, and engineer Chris Chew from Udacity. They will share their experiences on working with web applications, and you will see how all that you\u2019ve learned in this course comes into the big picture.\n\n###Final Project (8 hours)\nFor the final project, you will build a fully functional wiki - a website that allows any page to be edited. The wiki you will be able to build by the end of the course will feature the following: \n\n- Easily create new pages of the site by using the wiki edit capabilities. You should be able to enter a non-existent URL, redirect to an edit page, and create a new page from there. \n- Have user accounts so that logged-in users only will have edit privileges. \n- Use caching functionality.\n- Have a history section which displays the different wiki versions that have existed.", "assistants": [{"bio": "Sean Bennett is a Course Architect at Udacity and is passionate about using the web to improve the quality of education available worldwide.

(1 hour)\nWe'll start by learn about what exploratory data analysis (EDA) is and why it is important. You'll meet the amazing instructors for the course and find out about the course structure and final project.\n\n### Lesson 2: R Basics (3 hours)\nEDA, which comes before formal hypothesis testing and modeling, makes use of visual methods to analyze and summarize data sets. R will be our tool for generating those visuals and conducting analyses. In this lesson, we will install RStudio and packages, learn the layout and basic commands of R, practice writing basic R scripts, and inspect data sets.\n\n### Lesson 3: Explore One Variable (4 hours)\nWe perform EDA to understand the distribution of a variable and to check for anomalies and outliers. Learn how to quantify and visualize individual variables within a data set as we begin to make sense of a pseudo-data set of Facebook users. While the data set does not contain real user data, it does contain a wealth of information. Through the lesson, we will create histograms and boxplots, transform variables, and examine tradeoffs in visualizations.\n\n### Problem Set 3 (2 hours)\n\n### Lesson 4: Explore Two Variables (4 hours)\nEDA allows us to identify the most important variables and relationships within a data set before building predictive models. In this lesson, we will learn techniques for exploring the relationship between any two variables in a data set. We'll create scatter plots, calculate correlations, and investigate conditional means.\n\n### Problem Set 4 (2 hours)\n\n### Lesson 5: Explore Many Variables (4 hours)\nData sets can be complex. In this lesson, we will learn powerful methods and visualizations for examining relationships among multiple variables. We'll learn how to reshape data frames and how to use aesthetics like color and shape to uncover more information. Extending our knowledge of previous plots, we'll continue to build intuition around the Facebook data set and explore some new data sets as well.\n\n### Problem Set 5 (2 hours)\n\n### Lesson 6: Diamonds and Price Predictions (2 hours)\nInvestigate the diamonds data set alongside Facebook Data Scientist, Solomon Messing. He'll recap many of the strategies covered in the course and show how predictive modeling can allow us to determine a good price for a diamond. As a final project, you will create your own exploratory data analysis on a data set of your choice.\n\n### Final Project (10+ hours)\nYou've explored simulated Facebook user data and the diamonds data set.

Mobile platforms all come with a unique set of constraints and opportunities and this lesson will help you respect those constraints while taking advantage of the opportunities. \n\n### Lessons\n\n#### Lesson 1: What is User Experience?\nIn this lesson you will think about User Experience from the highest level. You will break down complex apps into a small number of simple steps and think about their big picture flow (including ones that you have worked on in the past or are currently working on). \n\n*Topics covered:*\n\n* What is UX?\n* UI vs. UX\n* High-level planning\n* Low-fi wireframing and prototyping\n* Two concrete app improvements to implement now\n\n#### Lesson 2: User-Centered Design\nIn this lesson you will learn how to design apps that your users will love. You will learn the importance of user-centered design, what happens when you design for everyone/no one (spoiler alert: it\u2019s generally bad), and how to effectively use tools like personas and use cases to ensure a baseline level of quality for anything you build. You will also learn a bit about how to use cheap and easy user research techniques to make well-informed design decisions. \n\n*Topics covered:*\n\n* The perils of ignoring your user\n* How to create effective personas and use cases\n* Low cost user research\n* How to use personas and use cases to inform feature lists\n\n#### Lesson 3: Designing for Mobile Constraints\n\nMobile design and development come with constraints and opportunities. This lesson is about the constraints. You will learn what constraints are inherent to mobile development and how to use design tools and techniques to ensure your app actually respects those constraints. \n\n*Topics covered:*\n\n* The 5 big constraints: limited data, finite battery, hand-held usage, divided user attention, and small screens.\n* The implications of these constraints and what happens when you get them wrong.\n* Advanced wireframing\n\n#### Lesson 4: Designing for Android Delight\n\nAt this point, you will already know how to make a solid mobile app that users like. But like isn\u2019t enough! In order to be really successful, your app needs to be *loved*. In this lesson, you\u2019ll learn how to leverage the power of Android by using device sensors and Google APIs to understand your user\u2019s context.\n\n*Topics covered:*\n\n* Android sensors\n* The importance of contextual apps\n* The \u201ccomponents\u201d of context\n* Android APIs (Google Play Services)\n\n### Final Project\nIn your final project, you will create high/mid-level design specifications for your own incredible Android app. You'll begin work on this project in the Assignments for Lesson 2, and continue working on it until the end of the course. \n\nWhen it's finished, you will have the blueprint for an app that will:\n\n* Be designed for a specific target user.\n* Have an almost-perfect high level flow.\n* Avoid all major mobile pitfalls.\n* Use Android sensors and APIs to understand your user's context and deliver context-aware moments of amazement that they will love.", "assistants": [{"bio": "Andy Brown is a Lead Instructor at Udacity.

These apps are typically business apps: they solve organizational and logistical problems. You probably wouldn\u2019t use Salesforce to build a computer game (though you could!).\n\nThere are two ways to build apps in Force.com: with or without code. This class will only cover the non-coding, point-and-click app building interface. But don\u2019t be fooled! Building powerful apps does not require writing code. \n\nThis class contains an introductory lesson, five primary lessons where you'll be building and learning (each of which has an accompanying problem set to practice your skills), and a final project where you'll put everything together.\n\n### Lesson 0: What is Salesforce (15 mins)\nWhat **is** Salesforce Platform? What does it do? Why should I learn about it? What kind of jobs can I get after I learn how to use it?\n\nIn this lesson, you\u2019ll meet the instructors, get to know the class, and learn a bit about Salesforce in general. \n\n### Lesson 1: Creating your First App (90 minutes)\nIn this lesson you\u2019ll get acquainted with Force.com and actually build the beginnings of your first app. You\u2019ll get some experience taking a big problem (in this case, managing a music festival), breaking it into smaller parts, and representing those parts in Salesforce. As you do this, you\u2019ll learn about the basic components of a Salesforce app and add some simple (but powerful) functionality to your app. More concretely, you\u2019ll learn about:\n\n* **Salesforce Data**: Salesforce represents data as objects, fields, and records. You\u2019ll learn what these terms mean and build them into your app. \n* **Relationships**: When the pieces of your app start communicating, interesting things can happen. In this lesson you\u2019ll learn the basics of Salesforce relationship fields. \n* **Validation Rules**: If you\u2019ve ever incorrectly entered your credit card number into a website, you already know about validation rules. In this lesson, you\u2019ll learn how to build them into your app. \n* **Formulas and Summaries**: These tools let you easily keep track of quantifiable things like money spent, customers contacted, or tickets sold. In this lesson you\u2019ll learn how to build these automated calculations into your app.  \n\n### Lesson 2: Building out your Data Model (90 mins)\nBehind every powerful business app is a well-planned data model (also known as a schema). In this lesson you\u2019ll learn how to decompose a complex problem into its component pieces and then connect those pieces together with the appropriate relationship fields. The data model you build will serve as the schematic skeleton onto which you\u2019ll build dynamic functionality in later lessons. The specific topics covered are: \n\n* **One-to-Many Relationships**: These relationships let the pieces of your app talk to each other. In this lesson you\u2019ll learn how and when (and why) to use master-detail and lookup relationships in the apps you build. \n* **Many-to-Many Relationships**: You\u2019ll learn how to use a junction object to add flexibility into your data model. \n* **Customizing the User Interface**: Good apps should be easy to use! In this lesson you\u2019ll learn how to configure the layout of your app to make sure the UI is simple and intuitive.\n* **Schema Builder**: There are many ways to get things done in Salesforce. In this lesson you\u2019ll start using the schema builder to understand how your app works.\n* **Data Loading**: This is a convenient way to get lots of data onto your app at once.\n\n### Lesson 3: Visualizing your Data (45 mins) \nNo matter what kind of app you\u2019re building, you\u2019ve probably got some data that you want other people in your organization to understand quickly and easily. In this lesson you\u2019ll learn how quickly communicate information with  real-time data visualizations. Specifically, you\u2019ll learn how to make:\n\n* **Reports**: These let you gather related information into one place.  These let you gather data according to specific criteria and display it in neat rows and columns. \n* **Charts**: These let you graphically summarize the information in a report.\n* **Dashboards**: Different people want access to different information. A dashboard is a collection of charts that give specific people in your organization exactly the information that they need in real-time.\n* **Views**: Data is good, but sometimes you have too much. Views let you selectively and quickly display only the data you care about.\n\n### Lesson 4: Adding Automation (45 mins)\nIn this lesson you\u2019ll think about how to use your app to automate manual tasks. You\u2019ll learn how to use two important Salesforce tools: \n\n* **Workflows**: There are situations where a series of steps need to happen in sequence: first do this, then do that. Workflows let you automate processes like these, such as sending an email, assigning a task, or updating a field.\n* **Approval Processes**: You don\u2019t want every job to be completely automated. Sometimes you need someone to step in and say \u201cthis looks good.\u201d Approval processes add a human element to your automated tasks.\n\n### Lesson 5: Make it Social. Make it Mobile. (45 mins)\nThis is it. With a few clicks of the mouse you\u2019ll make your app social and mobile. The tools you\u2019ll use are:\n\n* **Chatter**: This will let your users collaborate on the projects and records they work on together.  \n* **Salesforce1**: That web app you\u2019ve been building this whole time? It\u2019s actually a mobile app too. You\u2019ll even learn how to quickly customize your mobile interface and add functionality for mobile productivity. \n\n### Final Project: Build your own App (2-4 hours)\nBy the time you get here, you will have already built a music festival management app. Now it\u2019s time to take your own idea and turn it into a functional web and mobile app.", "assistants": [], "new_release": false, "available": true, "project_name": "Create Your Own Salesforce App", "full_course_available": true, "faq": "", "affiliates": [{"image": "https://lh3.ggpht.com/nr4_Gfu9oiAipeZOVzsizRT14K3QE2_qil8L11BdaXaLUbEnLn17DDNy8pabYlYbofw9wcyyETcI3ETr5b4=s0#w=130&h=60", "name": "Salesforce", "key": "Salesforce"}], "tracks": ["All", "Web Development"], "banner_image": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/NaWEGnVTrwLQwzIzNM7m0uQCu1hv0nJL3Y12-F_Ml8iOUxA4Y1ozHrYnokYsPhLq9fCSwuoO3h9hUoqm00I=s0#w=4680&h=968", "short_summary": "In this short class you'll build powerful apps without writing code.

You don't need to know any specific HTML5 extras or APIs, we'll cover any of those that we need as the course progresses.", "syllabus": "In this course, you will learn how to build web experiences that adapt to the different screen sizes and capabilities that mobile devices offer, and how to scalably optimize media for mobile and desktop.  We will cover programming touch interaction, as well as how to optimize form field input for mobile devices and use APIs like geolocation and the accelerometer, and ensuring your web experiences work great when network conditions are sub-optimal.  Finally, you\u2019ll gain the tools to investigate performance in mobile applications, with a strong understanding of mobile networking, battery usage patterns and optimizing paint techniques to build smooth animations on mobile.\n\n### Lesson 01: Syllabus\nWe\u2019ll start with a high-level overview of the course and what to expect in it. We\u2019ll also go into more depth on what we mean by mobile web development, and why you should care about it.\n\n### Lesson 02: Mobile Development Tools\nWorkflow and tooling is incredibly important for building great web apps, and this carries over to mobile web development. This lesson will show you how to use the Chrome Developer Tools to develop for the mobile web.\n\n### Lesson 03: Mobile UX and Viewport\nDesigning for the mobile web is all about a smooth user experience. This lesson will get you thinking about how to achieve that on mobile, and we\u2019ll introduce the first of many tools you need to achieve this: the viewport.\n\n### Lesson 04: Fluid Design\nMobile means lots of different devices and form factors. We\u2019ll discuss how to make your site responsive, clean, and user-friendly on multiple devices and layouts.\n\n### Lesson 05: Media Queries\nSometimes different devices call for fundamentally different layouts. This lesson will teach you how to achieve this using media queries.\n\n### Lesson 06: Responsive Images\nMedia requirements are different in mobile - network constraints and very high resolution screens set up a conflict that can be challenging.  We\u2019ll talk about how best to integrate media into your mobile web applications, and adaptively scaling images based on the environment.\n\n### Lesson 07: Optimizing Performance\nUsers expect a fast, seamless experience on mobile. We\u2019ll go over optimizing various performance metrics to improve that experience, such as network, cpu, rendering, and battery performance.\n\n### Lesson 08: Touch\nTouch input is fundamentally different from mouse input, and requires you to think about your user interactions differently. We\u2019ll go over UX concerns with touch-based interaction, and how to design user interactions that work across devices.\n\n### Lesson 09: Input\nUsing a keyboard on mobile is awful. We\u2019ll discuss ways to improve it, using semantic input for form data, and other user input options on mobile.\n\n### Lesson 10: Device Access\nMobile devices have a full array of sensors typically unavailable on desktop. We\u2019ll talk about camera access, geolocation, and other sensors and feedback you have access to on mobile.\n\n### Lesson 11: Offline and Storage\nIt\u2019s an unfortunate reality that mobile users aren\u2019t always online. We\u2019ll go over using the local cache as well as local storage APIs to give your users a great offline (and partially-online) experience as well.\n\n### Lesson 12: Wrap-up\nWe\u2019ll finish up the class by talking briefly about other topics to consider, such as app experience, monetization, deployment and distribution.

There are countless ways to start. And as a novice, it's hard to even know what you actually need to learn. This barrier to entry prevents many people from learning the life-changing skill of programming. \n\nThis Nanodegree is meant to remove that barrier by providing a simple path to the knowledge, skills, and ways of thinking that programmers in any field use all the time. \n\nAfter completing this Nanodegree you will not be an an expert programmer. But you will know enough to be dangerous and you'll have the power to make an informed choice about what you want to do next. You may decide to pursue a career in tech or you may be satisfied with the technical literacy, programming skills and mindsets you've developed. \n\nRegardless of your choice, you will be changed in three important ways.\n\n1. **You will have new knowledge**. This new knowledge will let you communicate effectively with professional programmers, teach your friends and family how the internet works, and understand the most important concepts in programming.\n2. **You will have new skills**. These skills will let you build web pages that others can use, automate repetitive tasks in your life, and quickly find the appropriate educational resources for whatever programming skills you choose to learn in the future.\n3. **You will have new ways of thinking**. This Nanodegree will focus on five thinking styles that programmers use all the time. Once you've acquired them, you'll find that \"thinking like a programmer\" gives you a new set of tools for thinking about areas of your life that may have nothing to do with programming at all.", "featured": false, "capped": false, "teaser_video": {"youtube_url": "", "transcodings": {}}, "title": "Introduction to Programming Nanodegree", "expected_duration_low": 4, "required_knowledge": "This Nanodegree is meant for someone with no technical background.", "syllabus": "## What You Will Build\n\nAs you progress through this Nanodegree you will document what you're learning in a web page that you'll build as you go. By the end you will have a fully-functioning web page to share with your friends and family. This web page will:\n\n### Look Professional\nBy using a \"styling\" language called CSS, you will be able to quickly and easily change the look and feel of your web page. While learning CSS, you'll also gain experience with one of the most important concepts in computer science: avoiding repetition through something called *abstraction*. \n\n### Display Videos\nIn addition to your own notes about what you're learning, you'll learn to write computer code in a language called Python that will embed your favorite videos (from Udacity or anywhere else) directly onto your web page. While learning  Python, you'll be developing a skill that's required for every programming project regardless of language: using procedural thinking to tell a computer exactly what you want it to do.\n\n\n### Be User-Friendly\nEven though *you* will have the skills to modify your web page by changing the code it's made from, the people you show it to may not. You'll add a form that allows visitors to add their own content to your page (if you let them of course). While you're learning what to do with information that someone submits to your web page, you'll also gain a deeper understanding for how the internet works and how computer programmers assemble complex programs by combining pieces of computer code that others have written before them. \n\n## How You Will Learn to Build it\n\nThis Nanodegree consists of a series of 5 courses. In each one, you will learn new broadly-applicable technical skills. After each course, you will complete a project checkpoint, where you apply your new skills by adding functionality to your web page, then submit your work for valuable feedback on your progress.  \n\n### Course 1: A Web of Structured Documents\nYou will learn the basics of how the internet works and how documents written in a language called HTML form the backbone of the Web. In the **project checkpoint** at the end you'll *write HTML and CSS (another language) to make your web page look professional.*\n\n### Course 2: Telling Computers What to Do\nThis is the course where you'll learn how to program. You'll learn a programming language called Python and you'll use it to write instructions that the computer can understand and execute. After this course you will have incredible power: you will be able to automate almost any repetitive task that can be done on a computer. In the **project checkpoint** you will *write a program that automatically makes web pages.*\n\n### Course 3: The Power of Reusing Code\nIn this course you will learn an entirely new approach to programming (and thinking) called Object Oriented Programming and how to use this approach to build impressive programs by simply reusing or modifying computer code that others have already written. In the **project checkpoint**, you will *embed YouTube videos directly into your web site.*\n\n### Course 4: Working with the Full Stack\nUp to this point, you still haven't put your web page online: you've only seen it on your own computer. In this course, you will gain a deeper understanding for how the internet works and will write code which tells computers called \"servers\" how to display web pages. In the **project checkpoint** you will *put your web page online and build what's called a \"back end\" which will allow people anywhere in the world to view and--if you let them--modify your site.*\n\n### Course 5: The Rest of the Programming World\nAt this point, you will already have a solid understanding of most of the essential concepts and skills that programming requires. This course will be a rapid sampling of some of the ideas that you haven't seen. You'll be introduced to ideas around topics like:\n\n* algorithms\n* efficiency\n* what makes code \"good\"\n* what it's like to work as a programmer\n* programming for mobile devices\n\nAnd more. In the **project checkpoint** you will *pursue one of these ideas even deeper by adding new functionality (you get to choose what) to your web page.*", "assistants": [], "new_release": true, "available": true, "project_name": "", "full_course_available": true, "faq": "", "affiliates": [], "tracks": ["All"], "banner_image": "https://lh6.ggpht.com/Fnv18TpBOzfB9_tRdymjvTY4pwwiiYlgcC86vaZrIVNbHcqR6FAtypjbZlRsL2CijQE5VuF-Y8ehmi8vJA=s0#w=4680&h=968", "short_summary": "Welcome to the world of programming.
